# Specify the fields that we want for search with a search-specific
# fragments for two reasons:
#
# (a) we need less data to render list items than we do full items
# (b) this caches a search results and full items seperately.  If an item is added here that is not in search results
#		it will get set to null and the more detailed response will not overwrite it with the real value
#		tl;dr; DO NOT add fields here unless they are actually returned by the search result
